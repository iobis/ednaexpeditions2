<h2>Draft Biobanking Agreement</h2>

<h3>Preamble</h3>

<p>This agreement sets out the terms under which environmental DNA (eDNA) samples are contributed to the eDNA expeditions - phase 2 central biobank, located at the University of Western Australia. Samples will be analysed as part of the project for 10-15 different biomarkers for a comprehensive picture on the species presence across the full tree of life. If, after this analysis, there is DNA remaining from the samples, they will be stored in the biobank for potential future biodiversity research for conservation purposes. The purpose of the biobank is to enable biodiversity research, both now and in the future, in compliance with the general principles of the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit-Sharing.</p>

<h3>Sample ownership</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The samples remain the property of the collecting party (Contributor), unless otherwise agreed in writing.</li>
    <li>The Coordinating Institution is responsible for storing and safeguarding the samples but does not acquire ownership.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conditions of use</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Samples will only be used for biodiversity research purposes.
    <li>Samples will not be used for commercial, medical, agricultural, or other non-biodiversity purposes without the explicit written consent of the Contributor.</li>
    <li>Any use of samples will require prior consent from the Contributor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Biobank storage location</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Contributor agrees that the samples will be stored in the central biobank maintained by the University of Western Australia.</li>  
  <li>The purpose of storage is to allow future biodiversity-related analyses, such as deeper sequencing or targeted studies.</li>
  <li>The Contributor may request the return or destruction of their samples at any time, subject to confirmation of identity and ownership.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Term and termination</h3>

<p>This agreement remains in effect until samples are withdrawn by the owner or disposed of according to agreed retention policies and applicable regulations.</p>

<h3>Consent and Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>By signing below, the Contributor confirms that:</p>
<ol>
<li>They understand and agree to the conditions described above.</li>
<li>They consent to the storage of their samples in the central biobank.</li>
<li>They retain ownership and the right to approve or decline any proposed use of their samples.</li>
<li>They acknowledge that the purpose of this arrangement is to support biodiversity research.</li>
</ul></ol>
