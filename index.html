                    <p>The eDNA Expeditions (Phase II) is a global effort to explore the life of our oceans through environmental DNA. Over the next three years (2026-2028), the project will build capacity in eDNA sampling and enable operational, standardized data collection across marine sites worldwide. Around 25 marine sites will receive sampling kits, training, and support to help uncover the hidden biodiversity of their waters. Together, we'll create a living, open dataset that connects local discovery to our shared global Ocean story—empowering communities to see and listen to the Ocean in new ways.</p>
                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>The first phase of eDNA Expeditions was a global citizen science initiative that engaged 250 citizen scientists, as young as 6 years old, across 19 countries, who identified over 4,000 species through eDNA sampling. Building on this experience, we now want to continue to include and inspire communities to discover their biodiversity, while also providing scientific insights with repeated samplings at the sites!</p>

We want to demonstrate how local empowerment radically amplifies Ocean diversity, from the data collected to the communities involved. Each sample collected contributes to a broader understanding of marine biodiversity. Each sample contributes to strengthening the role of local communities and actors as active protectors of their ecosystems.
