  <li>✔️ It is a marine area with ecological, cultural, or conservation importance (MPA, biosphere reserve, marine World Heritage site, national reserve, etc.)</li>
  <li>✔️ There is a team that can conduct simple, hands-on water sampling a few times a year (training and kits included)</li>
  <li>✔️ You want to access biodiversity information that is otherwise difficult or costly to obtain, such as rare species detections, community composition, or early signs of change</li>
  <li>✔️ You value public engagement, education, or outreach activities</li>
  <li>✔️ It is ready to join a fantastic project to increase our global ocean knowledge!</li>
