Are you a marine site manager, or part of a team that can organize sampling activities at a marine site and commit for the full three years of the project? If so, you can apply via the application form. No worries if you are not an expert or a trained scientist: the sampling protocol has been designed to be inclusive and fool-proof.

        In eDNA Expeditions 2026–2028, a participating site refers to the broader marine area of ecological, cultural, or conservation importance that is part of the project.

        A sampling location refers to a specific, smaller marine area within that site where eDNA sampling activities are carried out.

        Time commitment varies depending on the context at each participating site, especially how easy it is to access sampling locations and how the site plans to use the results. For some sites, sampling locations are accessible from shore, and a small team can complete a sampling campaign in a short field visit. For other sites, sampling requires vessels or expeditions, larger teams, and more planning time. In addition to fieldwork, sites should plan time for coordination (campaign scheduling, engagement with local communities for at least one sampling event, logistics, and shipping) and for reviewing results with the eDNA Expeditions 2026-2028 project team. Some participating sites will also choose to invest additional time to integrate the results into local management or conservation action strategies, while others may use the dashboards primarily for monitoring and reporting.
