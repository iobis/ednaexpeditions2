                    <p>The eDNA Expeditions are conducted under the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, with the Ocean Biodiversity Information System, a programme component of IOC, providing the bioinformatics pipeline and the data backbone for the project.</p>
                    <p>The IOC is a foundational driver for the eDNA Expeditions, connecting the project to a global Ocean science framework and ensuring its alignment with the objectives of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.</p>
                    <p>The IOC also plays a crucial supporting role in amplifying the eDNA Expeditions’ reach by providing a global stage for the project’s outcomes and increasing the visibility of its participants.</p>
