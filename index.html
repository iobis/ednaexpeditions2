<h2>Engaging Communities to Monitor Ocean Life</h2>
<p>The <b>IOC-UNESCO eDNA Expeditions (Phase II)</b> is a global effort to explore the invisible life of our oceans through environmental DNA. Over the next three years (2026-2028), the project will build capacity in eDNA sampling and enable operational, standardized data collection across marine sites worldwide. Around 25 marine sites will receive sampling kits, training, and support to help uncover the hidden biodiversity of their waters. Together, we’ll create a living, open dataset that connects local discovery to our shared global ocean story—empowering communities to see, and listen to, the ocean in new ways.</p>
<p>The first phase of eDNA Expeditions was a global citizen science initiative, that engaged 250 citizen scientists, as young as 6 years old, across 19 countries, who identified over 4,000 species through eDNA sampling. Building on this experience, we now want to continue to include and inspire communities to discover their biodiversity, while also providing scientific insights with repeated samplings at the sites!</p>

<p>eDNA sampling is a powerful tool, with which a small sampling effort can lead to a large amount of information on biodiversity at the marine sites. eDNA sampling provides presence information of species, and can therefore be used for specific purposes; like detecting rare or invasive species, and evaluating changes in community composition for example. Together with the sites, we now want to explore what are the monitoring questions that can be supported by eDNA sampling at the sites.</p>

<h2>Join the Movement</h2>
<p>Be part of a global movement to uncover the hidden stories of life around us. As an eDNA Expeditions site, you'll receive training, educational resources, and sampling kits that empower you to “listen to nature” through the DNA traces left behind in your environment. You’ll explore the unseen biodiversity of your own backyard and contribute to a living, shared dataset—continuously growing and viewable through the eDNA dashboard. </p>
<p>As of October 2025, we are collecting applications from marine sites to be a part of this program! Are you working in or with a marine site that is interested to be a part of this work? </p>
